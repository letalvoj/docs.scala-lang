"The book for new developers who want to learn Scala and have fun. Creative Scala is aimed at developers who have no prior experience in Scala. It is designed to give you a fun introduction to functional programming. We assume you have some very basic familiarity with another programming language but little or no experience with Scala or other functional languages. We've chosen what we hope is a fun method to explore functional programming and Scala: computer graphics."
